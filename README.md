# Bamazon

Bamazon is a simulated online marketplace that runs on the command line using Node.js.

## How to Use

The Bamazon application comes with three distinct "Views", Customer, Manager, and Supervisor. The Customer can order items from Bamazon, the Manager can restock items and add new items for sale, and the Supervisor can check each department's profits and add new departments.

_________

## Customer View

To enter the Customer View, run `node customer` from the application's root directory.

This will display all items that are avilable for purchase, and then prompt the user to choose an item and state how many of that item they intend to purchase.

If there is enough of that item in stock, the purchase will go through. If there is not enough, the user will be told that the stock is insufficient.

## Manager View

To enter the Manager View, run `node manager` from the application's root directory.

The Manager View provides 4 different actions:

* ### View All Products

	This command displays all available products in the store: their IDs, names, prices, and remaining stock.

## Supervisor View

To enter the Supervisor View, run `node supervisor` from the application's root directory.

The Supervisor View provides 2 different actions:

* ### View Product Sales by Department

	This command prints a table that lists each department's name and ID, along with its total sales, overhead costs, and total profit (sales - overhead).
